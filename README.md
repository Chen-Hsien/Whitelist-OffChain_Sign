# Sample Whitelist-OffChain_Sign

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

過去建立的專案都是單頁的solidity直接在Remix上部署, 這邊練習用HardHat來進行開發.  
選擇了[alchemy-Off-Chain NFT Allowlist](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-off-chain-nft-allowlist)專案來練習~.
